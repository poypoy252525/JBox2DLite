# JBox2DLite
Hello, My name is Carl Jefferson Delfin. I Ported Box2D Lite in Java that was originally created by Erin Catto
<br><b>Note:</b> Box2D lite broadphase O(n) is really slow it's only made for educational purpose.</br>
<br>Here is the sample of the code:</br>

<br>You can change the speed by changing the speed value inside the "GameScreen.java" class. increasing the speed value will increase the speed.</br>
<br><b>Note:</b> The speed that I implement is really bad. You should modify the code if you want to use it on your game.</br>
